Capstone_Simran.ipynb : 911 Calls Capstone Project
For this capstone project we will be analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle. Analyzed and fetched insights such as top 5 zip codes and towns, from where most of the calls are coming,
common reason for 911 call, created a heat map to understand and see the highest interactions
Tech stack: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn 
The data contains the following fields:
lat : String variable, Latitude
lng: String variable, Longitude
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
zip: String variable, Zipcode
title: String variable, Title
timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
twp: String variable, Township
addr: String variable, Address
e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)



Covid 19_Simran.ipynb : Created predictive models to estimate the number of covid 19 deaths, did data visualization of the information
using various plots
Tech stack: Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow, Seaborn, LSTM models



Stock Prediction.ipynb : Developed a prediction model for E-commerce stocks to predict their closing prices and get familiarize with the
terms; daily return and moving average
Tech stack: Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow, Seaborn, LSTM models, Matplotlib, NumPy



Topic_Modelling_Simran.ipynb : Used the Zomato reviews database, checked the frequency of words in their reviews by using stop word removal and removing special characters.
Visualized the cleaned data using a umap by implementing Topic Modelling.
Used concepts : tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, word embeddings, LDA and semantic analysis
Tech stack: Pandas, NumPy, pyLDavis, sklearn, NLTK
